This is our submission for the ["The Art of It All" NASA COVID-19 Space Apps Challenge](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges/art-it-all/teams/whale-in-space/project).

A live version of the online-interactive piece of art is available here: https://whale-in-space.web.app/.

# Summary

An attempt to convey personal emotions during the challenging COVID-19 times through an interactive piece of art.

# How We Addressed This Challenge

We have tried to capture our emotions during the COVID-19 crisis. Through introspection, we have discovered a feeling of claustrophobia when looking at the constant news stream of never-ending bad news. Health concerns, stress, lockdown, and gradual loss of privacy are but a few examples of what went through our minds.

# How We Developed This Project

The idea was to come up with a wild space-related piece of art that somehow captures our emotions during the COVID-19 crisis. We have started by creating a painting by letting our imagination flow and have then digitized it. By cropping out certain parts of the image and filling in the 'space behind', and then animating it and adding sound effects to it, we were able to give a static painting more depth and motion. It is now an online-interactive piece of art.

From the IT perspective, we have used Firebase, TypeScript, Vue/Vuetify, and Two.js for this project.
